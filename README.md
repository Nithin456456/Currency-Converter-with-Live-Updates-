# Currency-Converter-with-Live-Updates-
This Java program is a console-based currency converter that lets users convert amounts between different currencies using simulated real-time exchange rate updates.  The app starts with a few predefined exchange rates (USD, EUR, INR, JPY).  Every 5 seconds, the program automatically changes the rates slightly to simulate live market fluctuations.
